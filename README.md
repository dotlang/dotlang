# Other components

## Core packages

A set of core packages will provide basic and low-level functionality (This part may be written in C or LLVM IR):

- Calling C/C++ methods
- Interacting with the OS
- Load code on the fly and hot swap
- Data conversion
- Garbage collector (Runtime)
- Serialization and Deserialization
- Dump an object
- RegEx functions
- Concurrency
- Security policy (how to call a code you don't trust)
- Bitwise operators (and, or, shift, ...)

Generally, anything that cannot be written in dotLang will be placed in this package.

## Standard package

There will be another set of packages built on top of core which provide common utilities. This will be much larger and more complex than core, so it will be independent of the core and language (This part will be written in dotLang). Here is a list of some of classes in this package collection:

- I/O (Network, Console, File, ...)
- Collections (Stack, Queue, Linked List, ...)
- Encryption
- Math
- ...

## Package Manager

The package manager is a utility which helps you package, publish, install and deploy packages (Like `maven`, `NuGet` or `dub`).
Suppose someone downloads the source code for a project written in dotLang which has some dependencies. How is he going to compile/run the project? There should be an easy and transparent way to fetch dependencies at runtime and defining them at the time of development.
