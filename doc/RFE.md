Y - Builtin support for testing and doc
compiler will drop any unused function in the final output. 
from compiler's perspective, unit tests are a set of functions in the modules of the project that must be executed.
they don't have any input or output.
because there is no one to give them input. compiler cannot provide input.
If a test needs input, you should wrap it into a caller function.
so it will be in the form of: `fn{...}` in the source.
They don't have a name (because no one's gonna call them). no input. no output.
so:
```
_ = fn{ ... }
```
can be a unit test. but we want to make it more explicit.
option1:
`__ = fn{...}`
so:
module level functions that have no name are unit test.
But this is not good. We want them to have names to describe what/how they are testing.
e.g.
`testProcessWithInvalidInput = fn{...}`
so:
module level functions, without input that start with `_test` are considered test functions.
if they are not used anywhere, will be dropped from compiler output.
but you can force compiler to run them: `dotc test myProject`

? - The concept of process mailbox means a lot of stuff in the background.
replaces it with something like a channel object which we can send to or receive from functions
but what about `select`?
notations we need:
1. define a channel with no or some buffer: 
  `ch = 0`, `ch = [0,0,0]`
  `ch_r, ch_w = makeChannel(0) #or 1 or n`
2. read from channel: `ch_r(timeout_ms)`
3. write to channel `ch_w(data, timeout_ms)`
4. close channel: call `dispose`
5. select: idea: don't do it yourself, give developer primitives and let him (or std) handle that
if we make read, tryRead, and write, tryWrite, then what?
so, tryRead will reutrn nothing if cannot read. or the data read
tryWrite will return nothing if cannot write. or the data written
then user can use these to write their own select. or, we can provide a helper too.
this will also enable us to write our own default case: a function that always does the job.
what if we cannot close a channel? you can signal (using another channel) that this channel is no longer valid.
and stop reading from the channel.
we want to make it simple and minimal.
`ch_r, ch_w = makeChannel(size, identifier)`

? - Should we make `dispose` more built-in?
`dispose(x)`
`x = ` no x is suppose to be immutable.
`_ = x`
`nothing = x`
`x = nothing`
but isn't this against immutability?
what if another thread is using x?
I think you should not be able to dispose anything.
Just some specific functions that can be used to close a file, ...
and they are typed, so you cannot call them with any other type

? - If underscore has no meaning, why not ban it?
so underscore will be for destruction and lambda creation
so putting `_` at the beginning of a binding/type name can have a special meaning? or it can be banned.

? - Can we have a pattern that people can easily find functions/types/... in a file

? - Pro for fn for channels: we can compose them easily
