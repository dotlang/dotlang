Use this for stdio, sockets, ... 
inspire from linux Kernel

Y - Builtin support for testing and doc
compiler will drop any unused function in the final output. 
from compiler's perspective, unit tests are a set of functions in the modules of the project that must be executed.
they don't have any input or output.
because there is no one to give them input. compiler cannot provide input.
If a test needs input, you should wrap it into a caller function.
so it will be in the form of: `fn{...}` in the source.
They don't have a name (because no one's gonna call them). no input. no output.
so:
```
_ = fn{ ... }
```
can be a unit test. but we want to make it more explicit.
option1:
`__ = fn{...}`
so:
module level functions that have no name are unit test.
But this is not good. We want them to have names to describe what/how they are testing.
e.g.
`testProcessWithInvalidInput = fn{...}`
so:
module level functions, without input that start with `_test` are considered test functions.
if they are not used anywhere, will be dropped from compiler output.
but you can force compiler to run them: `dotc test myProject`

? - The concept of process mailbox means a lot of stuff in the background.
replaces it with something like a channel object which we can send to or receive from functions
